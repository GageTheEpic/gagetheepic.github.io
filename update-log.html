        <h2>This site is still a work in progress, <br>games will be removed and added over time, and changes <br>in design will likely happen.</h2>
        <p>This update-log is not every update, only ones that I thought were worthy of a proper update log, <br>there are lots of small updates that are just bug fixes.</p>
